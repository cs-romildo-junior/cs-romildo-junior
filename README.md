### Hello!
Hi, my name is Junior Mendes (he/him) and I'm a backend developer!
I love sharing skills, creating educational content and writing, then if you have something that I can help, get in touch with me!

### Things to know about me (for coworkers)
- ðŸ“Ÿ I love async/text based communication. You can message me any time - although maybe I'll reply latter;
- ðŸ‘‹ Use the "no hello" policy: [Please Don't Say Just Hello In Chat](https://www.nohello.com/);
- ðŸ“… If you want me for some synchronous activity, send-me a Microsoft Teams invitation;
